          <H2>Nominate a Speakers</H2>
          <p>
            If you want to nominate a person and idea that you would like to see,
            you can submit them via our submission
            form. Please be sure to include valid contact information so that we can reach out to
            your suggested speaker.
          </p>

          <H2>Selection Process</H2>
          <p>
            All submissions are anonymized before review in an attempt to remove any conscious or
            unconscious biases towards the submitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the volume of requests we receive and logistics of organizing,
            we may not be able to provide specific feedback to applications we do not select.
            Many submissions will simply be duplicative in terms of material convered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker details
            into account. This ensures a diverse speaker line-up of people from all
            backgrounds and speaking experience.
